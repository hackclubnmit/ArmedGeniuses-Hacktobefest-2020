# ArmedGeniuses

An ethical hacking guide/site made using HTML, CSS and JS.

### What's new:

- The Dark mode and Light mode toggle has now been introduced. It will be persistent and be applied to all the pages of the web page even when the page is refreshed.
- Your feedback is now stored in the browser local cache, so when you give in the feedback, the messsage is not stored as a text file in your system. This is made so that new feedback can keep coming in.

### Note:

- The feedback page has been updated to market the feedback of other people.
- When you fill the feedback, the message is taken and stored in the local cache of the browser. If you have to overwrite it, then you have to submit your feedback again.

### Issues:

- `contact --> feedback` page has a XSS vulnerability.
- Dark-light mode transition animation has to be done.
- The webpages has to be made responsive for mobile devices.
- Other documentation mistakes in the website such as spelling mistakes, grammar, etc.
