                <h4 class="guide-title ">Why Learn Hacking?</h4>
                <p class="guide-body">Not to be confused with malicious “black hat” hacking, ethical “white hat” hacking (also called penetration testing) identifies network security vulnerabilities and patches security holes before anyone can abuse them. <br /> <br /> If you
                    don’t understand how black hat hackers could get into your systems, you’re going to have a hard time securing them. Learning how to hack can help you implement the strongest possible security practices. It’s as much about finding and
                    fixing security vulnerabilities as it is about anticipating them. Learning about the methods hackers use to infiltrate systems will help you resolve issues before it's too late. <br />
                    <br /> Above everything else, successful ethical hacking requires being a master at problem solving. Understanding how computer systems and programming languages work is also essential because this type of knowledge can be useful in predicting which exploits or methods may be used by hackers to infiltrate your systems. <br />

                <h4 class="guide-title ">Importance of Ethical Hacking</h4>
                <p class="guide-body">
                    No business or government agency can run without computers and networks. Information and computer technology (ICT) is one of the primary requirements everywhere. However, as the dependency on technology rises, so does the vulnerability of technology. Everywhere, there is fear of cyber crime. It may be a terrorist organization or a gang of criminals; without your knowledge, they are able to steal your data, loot your financial assets, and hijack your website and so on. Once hacked, it’s almost impossible
                    to recover from the damages sustained. This is why system and network security should be your first priority.<br /> <br /> Based on statistical data, hackers attack on an average of every 38 seconds. The worldwide financial loss due to cyber attack projected to be $
                    155 million by 2020. 68% of networks are yet unprotected. These are some of the reasons why ethical hacking is important. Ethical hackers can save businesses and governments from immeasurable losses.<br />

                <p class="guide-body">
                    The job of an ethical hacker or a pentester is to test the security of a particular application or a network to find security vulnerabilities so that they can be patched and not be exploited. Here is an example of how a basic penetration test goes:

                <p class="guide-body">
                    Ethical Hacking has a lot of scope as a whole. It may have more or less of an impact in the country in which you're living, but it is indeed important. It is a high paying job provided you have a few years of experience. It estimates at around $120,000
                    a year. As of Jan 19, 2020, the average monthly pay for an Ethical Hacker in the United States is $9,983 a month. <br /> <br /> Hence, the demand for ethical hackers and security professionals is constantly increasing.
